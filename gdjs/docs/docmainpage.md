# GDJS Runtime \(JavaScript game engine\)

This is the documentation for GDJS JavaScript game engine used in GDevelop.

> GDevelop is an **open-source**, cross-platform **game creator** designed _to be used by everyone_. Download it on [gdevelop-app.com](https://gdevelop-app.com/) if you don't have it yet!

## Using the game engine in your game

When you're developing a game with GDevelop, your game is exported with the game engine and events of the game are using it.

If you're using JavaScript events in your game, consult this documentation. You may be interested in {@link gdjs.RuntimeObject} or {@link gdjs.RuntimeScene} classes.

## Development of the game engine \(advanced\)

If you want to work on the engine directly, follow the [GDevelop 5 README about development of the game engine](https://github.com/4ian/GD/blob/master/newIDE/README.md#development-of-the-game-engine) to get started. Refer to this documentation to know more about the engine.
