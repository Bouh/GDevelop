# README

This folder contains sources to embed Yarn editor \([https://github.com/InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn](https://github.com/InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn)\) so that it can be used directly from GDevelop to edit/create Dialogue Trees.

Yarn sources are downloaded by `import-zipped-editor.js` script. They are raw, unchanged sources of the Yarn editor build. Sources will be stored in `yarn-editor` folder. See `yarn-main.js` for the code running the editor. See `ModalWindow.js` and `LocalYarnBridge.js` files for the bridge that open the Window and pass data from GDevelop to yarn.
